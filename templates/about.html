<h1>About</h1>

<p>To populate the Funetik InggliÅ¡ (FI) database with words and their phonetic representations, I used several sources,
    three with just the English spelling and one that also contained phonetic data.</p>

<p>I performed SQL intersections on the data, to identify words which appeared in multiple sources
    as important words to include in this initial word database, which I hope will continue to grow.</p>

<p>I would like to expand this site to all users to create accounts and submit
    their own pronunciations of words, linked to their demographic data.</p>

<p>There are likely still inaccurate phonetic representations in the database, either from the source material 
    or from an over-reaching regular expression based SQL update statement which changed too many things.
    An example of this was changing words like "competition", which was represented as "K AA2 M P AH0 T IH1 SH AH0 N"
    in the CMU list, which would be "kamputiÅ¡un" in FI. I deemed it more accurate to write this as "kampitiÅ¡in".
    The first instance of schwa after "kamp" could fairly be either 'ÊŒ' or 'Éª', I think, but the final vowel before 'n' should
    definitely be 'Éª', not 'ÊŒ', as 'ÊŒ' in this position sounds and feels awkward. Simply replacing all words ending in -un 
    with -in wouldn't work, though, as the word "fun" would become "fin". Therefore, a more nuanced approach and a lot of proofreading
    was required.</p>
<p>While that is a seemingly minor change, other changes were <span class="straikthrw">brÉ”dÃ¸r</span> broader.
        For instance, in the interest of refining an elegant
        orthography, I elected not to include the open-mid back rounded vowel (É”), present in American English speakers without the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger" target="_blank">cotâ€“caught merger</a>. The CMU authors evidently did 
        pronounce words with this vowel, and as such I had to replace 'É”' with 'o' or 'a'. The CMU authors used 'É”' for both "almost" (AO1 L M OW2 S T) and "war" (W AO1 R).</p>
        <p>While descriptive grammar is the only way to go (my idiolect is certainly not "better"), I had to choose one way to write each word for the purposes of this thought experiment. 
            As long as it's consistent, it's better than the amalgam of historical accidents which is our current orthography.</p>

    <h2 id="cmu">The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</h2>

    <p>Source of pronunciation data which was substantially reformatted into a more readable format, with symbols for stress and syllable boundaries replacing the
        system of numbers.</p>
    <p>Most of the phonetic transliterations for Phonetic English were adapted from or at least compared against
        the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. I only used about a third of
        their data, and made several broad changes affecting all or many of the words to make them consistent
        with the funeticization I thought could represent a general American accent. The changes I made were 
        informed by my own
        intuitions and idiolect, as well as what I learned in my study of linguistics, but not based on a large
        sampling of speaker data.</p>

    <h2 id="silorg">wordsEn.txt from sil.org</h2>

    <p>A list of 109582 English words compiled and corrected in 1991 from lists obtained from the Interociter bulletin board. The original read.me file said that the list came from Public Brand Software.</p>
    <p>This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and the -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs. Thus the number of lexical stems represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total number of words.</p>
