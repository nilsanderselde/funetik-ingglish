    <p>Most of the phonetic transliterations for Phonetic English were adapted from or at least compared against
    the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. I only used about a third of
    their data, and made several broad changes affecting all or many of the words to make them consistent
    with the funeticization I thought could represent a general American accent. The changes I made were 
    informed by my own
    intuitions and idiolect, as well as what I learned in my study of linguistics, but not based on a large
    sampling of speaker data. I would like to expand this site to all users to create accounts and submit
    their own pronunciations of words, linked to their demographic data.</p>

<p>I based my implementation for calculating Levenshtein distance on the Python implementation
in the Natural Language Toolkit, part of the nltk.metrics.distance module.</p>
